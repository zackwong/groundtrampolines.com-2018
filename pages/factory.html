        <p>Leading by a senior engineer associated with Tiangong-1 in 2011, a group of hardworking engineers sweated on applying the military technologies, thick film heating technology and higher precision sensor technology, to products for civilian use.</p>
        <p>It took them 5 years to develop the technology until the first generation of Flexwarm products were simultaneously released in China and overseas markets in 2016.</p>
        <p>Comparing with existing electroheat products on the market, Flexwarm products offer a higher level of safety, energy efficiency, and comfortability, and thus, they enabled Flexwarm to get multi-million cloud funding on JD.com and Kickstarter.</p>
