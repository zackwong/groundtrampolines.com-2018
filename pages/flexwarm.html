        <p>The Patented Flexwarm Technology is unlike any heating technology around the globe. Over the past 7 years, our engineers have been researching and developing reliable and durable heating technology. Thanks for their dedication and persistence, the flexible heating elements now are thin (0.5mm) enough to be printed directly onto fabtic. Also, it is safe (low output voltage), durable and washable, along with precise temperature control feature. Therefore, the technology can be applied anywhere like garments, personal care items and home appliances.</p>
