<h3 class="margin-top-30">Equipment overview and structure introduction</h3>
<p><b>Product function:</b> Stand on the platform and use the balance force to slowly pass the bridge deck.</p>
<p><b>Product features:</b> Balance bridge brings more sports fun to children. The whole body muscle movement makes the body active and relaxed, promotes the development of the cerebellum, promotes brain development, improves intelligence, can exercise balance and nerve reflex ability, make shoulders, The ridges, legs, limbs, feet, and wrists are fully exercised to enhance physical fitness and improve immunity. Promote the balance, coordination and flexibility of the body.</p>
<p><b>Brand:</b> First Sports</p>
<p><b>Product Name:</b> Balance Bridge</p>
<p><b>Product model:</b> 9602ZH</p>
<p><b>Product shape:</b> bridge type</p>
<p><b>Product specifications:</b> platform Φ450mm height Φ425mm length can be customized</p>
<p><b>Safety range:</b> edge range 1500mm.</p>
<p><b>Surface treatment:</b> Electrostatic spraying platform is coated with EPDM after integral hot-dip galvanizing</p>
<p><b>Buried way:</b> expansion bolt fixing flange</p>
<p><b>Structure:</b></p>
<p>The base is made of high-quality hot-dip galvanized carbon steel plate by laser cutting and welding. The support tube is formed by bending Φ76mm diameter. The platform support plate is integrally stretched by 4mm galvanized sheet. The surface of the balance bridge platform is covered with a thickness of 20mm EPDM. The rubber particles are used to increase the friction and cushioning protection for the user. The EPDM particles have the advantages of non-toxic and harmless, anti-flame retardant, strong weather resistance, etc., and no fading, cracking, bulging, falling off, etc. after 900 hours of aging irradiation test. Phenomenon, the bridge deck splicing module is made of high-molecular urethane synthetic material for one-time injection molding. It has the advantages of non-toxic and harmless, anti-flame retardant, strong weather resistance, etc. It has no fading and cracking after 900 hours of aging test of xenon lamp. After 100,000 tests, the internal wire rope is not broken and the module is not deformed.</p>
<p>The bridge deck module can be equipped with a built-in carbon steel reinforcing plate, which greatly enhances the durability and stability of the product, completely solves the bridge surface fracture phenomenon, and achieves maintenance-free maintenance and replacement. The polymer urethane synthetic material has high elasticity, good rebound, good touch and no bluntness, which makes the child more comfortable during use. The bridge deck module is widened, and the gap between two adjacent modules is less than 8mm, which reduces the safety risk for the child's card holder. It fully complies with the GB/T 34272-2017 ride standard.</p>
<p>The wire rope and the connecting parts of each part are made of stainless steel. Built-in adjustments adjust the deck tension.</p>
