<p><b>Structure:</b></p>
<p>The base is made of high-quality hot-dip galvanized carbon steel plate by laser cutting and welding. The bearing ball is made by one-time stretch forming of stamping machine. The bearing spring is made of 65Mn high-strength spring steel. The rotating structure of the product is built-in self-developed special damper. The balance ball is limited in rotation speed to protect the safety of the user. The balance ball surface is covered with a layer of EPDM rubber particles for increasing friction and cushioning protection for the user. The EPDM particles are non-toxic, non-toxic and flame retardant. It has the advantages of strong weather resistance, no fading, cracking, aging, bulging, and aging after 900 hours of aging test. After balancing the ball fatigue test for 100,000 times, the spring has no deformation and fracture, and the resistance torque of the internal damper is not more than 50%.</p>
